This script automatically casts votes for NITT at the IndiaToday poll.

Instructions:

I have written the script with Linux users in mind. If you are using Windows, 
you would have to install Python 2.7, mechanize module, and make some changes 
to the code, if necessary. 

Step 1: Install Python 2.7 using your package manager

Step 2: Download and install mechanize
	Download link: http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/m/mechanize/mechanize-0.2.5.zip
	Extract the archive, change to the top-level directory, and run 
	python setup.py install

Step 3: Run the bot using the command
	python nittftw.py <number_of_votes>
